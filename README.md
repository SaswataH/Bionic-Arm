# Bionic Arm

An ML based hand gesture recognition model. Different hand poses are classified by the model implemented.

*[ This Readme.md is under going rapid changes right now, since a specific Data Analysis section is being included in the project, before training the ML model. ]*

## Future goals

1. Collecting even more varied datasets for better training.
2. Implementing other ML models like Neural Network to compare with the present S.V.M model.
3. Passing serial data through a Microcontroller to control a 3-d printed Palm using I2C protocol.
